# History

When working with the 'newest and greatest' Android and Kotlin projects, I find myself running into a large amount of build issues and intellisense annoyances.

Here is a centralized (and time-stamped) history of these issues, with solution or workaround, when found.

- `@StateObject` advertised as the [solution](https://www.avanderlee.com/swiftui/stateobject-observedobject-differences/#:~:text=%40StateObject%20and%20%40ObservedObject%20have%20similar,you%20can%20use%20the%20%40ObservedObject.) to the lifecycle.
